Module 14

I used XPERT learning assistant for a lot of help constructing the basic code.  I looked at a lot of the code that was given back to me and worked to understand what was happening in each part. XPERT learning assistant also helped me create key-value pairs and append it to the existing content in the div and I also asked for help on how to change the charts everytime a new ID was selected in the dropdown menu.  XPERT learning assistant did help me fix my code so that that every time a new ID was selected the corresponding data from that name is displayed ie "samples.find(item => item.id === sample)".  I also looked up on StackOverflow how to create dropdown menus using d3 and I looked at the Plotly documentation on how to create a bubble chart.
